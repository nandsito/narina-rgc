Refugees in Greece crawler

This project is a Web crawler, designed to get Greek government data on
refugee flows. It is also a use reference of some Java APIs and
libraries.

## Refugee flows data

Since 2016-03-21, on an almost daily basis, the Greek government started
publishing refugee flows data. Here is an example of a data spreadsheet:

This information could be aggregated and analyzed, hence the motivation
of making this solution.

## Java APIs and libraries

The project intends to employ good development practices so it can be
used as a reference for the chosen APIs and libraries, as well as be a
nice coding example in a general way.
